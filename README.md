# 📘 Student Planner — PWA

A premium, offline-first Student Planner Progressive Web App built with **HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3, and vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend, no accounts. Every byte of your data stays on your own device in `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a static site — no build step, no `npm install`.

### Option 1: Just open it
Open `index.html` directly in a browser. Most features work, but **installing as a PWA and the offline service worker require a real HTTP origin** (browsers block service workers on `file://`).

### Option 2: Serve it locally (recommended)
```bash
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```
or with Node:
```bash
npx serve .
```

### Option 3: Deploy it
Drop the folder as-is onto any static host — GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or a plain web server. No server-side code or environment variables needed.

## 🗄️ Data & Privacy

All data (subjects, tasks, notes, grades, attendance, habits, settings) is stored **only** in your browser's `localStorage` — nothing is sent to a server. Clearing your browser data or using a different browser/device means starting fresh, so use **Settings → Export All Data** regularly to back up, and **Import Data** to restore.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 (custom design system, glassmorphism, CSS variables for theming)
- [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) (layout & form primitives only — components are custom-styled)
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (weekly productivity chart)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+, no framework, no build tools)
- Canvas API (wallpaper generation)
- Service Worker API (offline support)

## 🌐 Browser Support

Latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari (desktop & mobile). PWA installability depends on the browser — Chromium-based browsers offer the fullest experience (install prompt, offline splash screen).
